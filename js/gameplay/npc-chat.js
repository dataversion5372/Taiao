// ===== Taiao — AI NPC dialogue (Nets ⇄ lfm2.5-230m) =====
// Every NPC within earshot gets its OWN ephemeral lfm2.5-230m instance (managed
// by tools/npc_bridge.py over the user's Nets framework). Type in the chat bar
// and every NPC in earshot answers, each in their own voice, as an overhead
// speech bubble. NPCs speak only when spoken to — unprompted earshot greetings
// are reserved for NPCs flagged npc.talksFirst (see npcChatTick). If the bridge
// isn't running the game falls back to the canned one-liners — nothing breaks.
