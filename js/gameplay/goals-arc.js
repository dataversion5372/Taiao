// First days in Newhaven — the authored post-graduation goal arc.
//
// The Bifrost crossing used to be a cliff: goalState() returns cur:null the
// moment t.graduated flips, the Goals tab collapses to "no goals remain",
// and a fresh graduate stands in Newhaven with a full pack and no thread to
// pull. This module hands them four first days' worth of thread:
//
//   1. bank the isle goods       (the pack is full — teach the shared vault)
//   2. take a ✦ quest            (the loop that replaces the keepers)
//   3. attune a portal           (the travel unlock that makes 4 painless)
//   4. set foot in a new biome   (the world is bigger than these plains)
//
// Steps are POLLED, not evented — quests/portals/biome are all cheap global
// reads, so a player who does them out of order (or did them before this
// module shipped) gets instant credit. Only bank deposits need a wire: we
// wrap depositToBank the same way pulse.js does (shared-global bundle scope,
// wrap-by-reassignment; this file loads after both ui.js and pulse.js).
//
// State nests under player.tutorial.arc — player.tutorial round-trips whole
// through storage.js, so no save-schema change. Veterans whose saves carry
// player.tutorial === null (pre-isle era) never see the arc; graduates from
// BEFORE this module get it seeded on their next boot, with any already-done
// steps checking off at once.
//
// main.js calls GoalsArc.tick() beside Tutorial.tick() (same !cine gate, so
// the arc stays silent until the Bifrost cinematic has let go of the sky);
// main/ui.js renderGoals() consults GoalsArc.state() for the graduated view.
