  // --- IndexedDB chunk cache ---
  // Keyed by fixed world id + coords.
  // Writes are fire-and-forget; reads warm the in-memory chunks Map before the
  // game loop starts so synchronous getChunk() always finds a hot entry.
  // Bumped to v5: mansions are now a 3-storey hall with three ATTACHED
  // 2-storey wings (shared walls + archways), towers are 6x6, observatories
  // 9x9 — all stamped into tiles, so older cached chunks would disagree with
  // the renderer/collision. Chunk data is fully deterministic from the seed,
  // so old chunks simply regenerate.
  // Bumped to v6: settlement buildings are now furnished by trade (casks in the
  // cooper's, candles in the chandler's, locks in the locksmith's, pottery in the
  // potter's, sails in the sail loft, a hull on the shipyard stocks, etc.) and
  // POIs/civic rings gained more props, so cached chunks must regenerate.
  // Bumped to v8: bridges span bank-to-bank (stone_bridge decor over approach
  // roads, staggered 1-tile "#p" support piers), and river-spanning buildings
  // keep a hollow channel + bank strip with a second north door.
  // Bumped to v20: climate rework — triangle latitude + warmCurve makes the
  // warm:polar land ratio ~3:1 (was ~40:60), reshuffling biomes world-wide.
  // Bumped to v21: portals moved to a sparse dedicated lattice (>= 500 game
  // tiles apart, features.js portalSite) and three new POIs (runecircle,
  // banditcamp, huntercamp) replaced the tables' portal slots.
  // Bumped to v22: boulders, mossy boulders and wildflowers now generate as
  // mineable/pickable resource NODES instead of static decor (gather-decor.js).
  // Bumped to v23: pasture livestock (chicken/sheep/cow) scattered across
  // grass/farm/meadow biomes for the roaming-animal Husbandry rework.
  // Bumped to v24: fishing spots are now per-fish (procedural rarity) with a
  // 5-10 catch counter — node types/placement changed, so regenerate.
  // Bumped to v25: new husbandry animals (quail/duck/goat/rabbit/pig) scattered
  // in pastures + griffons in the crags.
  // Bumped to v26: batch 2 (goose/turkey/buffalo/alpaca pastures; aurochs/wyrmling crags).
  // Bumped to v28: fenced farm fields (per-skill soil + gate) generate in Farmland
  // biome; Newhaven's prototype seed patch removed — node/decor layout changed.
  // v36: bank chests added to POIs (manor/towers/lighthouse/fishvillage/
  // campsite) + wayside wild chests — cached chunks must regenerate to get them
  // v37: roads crossing shallow SEA now deck over as overpass bridges (sea
  // stone_bridge tiles + 4-lattice piles + coastal approach decking)
  // v38: fishing spots are WATER-TYPE aware — freshwater (rivers/lakes) holds a
  // new "river" band (kōura + shortfin eel, hīnaki-potted) and never sea fish;
  // sea shore/deep/abyss bands no longer leak inland. Cached spots regenerate.
  // v39: parallel roads merge — later road edges re-lane along the FINAL route
  // of earlier edges (admissible corridor A*), and road jitter uses a plateau
  // envelope, so two roads to the same destination share one drawn road.
  // v40: bank MAIN BRANCHES — one deterministic city per bank network hosts a
  // grand 3-storey bank hall (kind "mainbank", its own city block) with a row
  // of teller chests and banker staff; the city's bank job moved onto it.
  // v41: bank networks follow the ROAD WEB (features.js roadNetId), not the
  // terrain flood — road-isolated cities (Keolwulfduun) become their own
  // networks and gain their own main-branch hall, so city layouts change.
  // v42: WORLD name registry — settlement/landmark names are now allocated
  // per 15000²-tile world (unique within a world, disjoint from all 8
  // neighbours); nearly every name changed and labels embed names.
  // v43: bank networks span the WHOLE road web (features.js dropped the
  // trunk-length and sea-deck edge cutoffs) — cities that were their own
  // network's main branch (Hegestesduun, Easthuus…) lose their grand bank
  // hall to Newhaven's, so their city layouts change.
  // v44: gem-vein tiers are cubic-rarity-biased (mineExtraNode) — Quartz
  // boulders most abundant, high tiers rare — so wild node scatter changes.
  // v45: Tūhura Isle rework — erosion no longer mangles the hand carve
  // (erosion.js restores the analytic isle elevation), staged water art,
  // straight waist gate-fences + water-edge posts, clean flush bridge deck.
  // Persisted isle chunks hold the old ragged ground/decor.
  // v46: isle round 2 — private deepening OCEAN out to D<130 (no foreign
  // land in sight), waist/river fences march out to the D<14 line, whitebait
  // PEN fence + gate, forge terrace = 1 iron + 1 tin, undertow removed.
  // v47: the whitebait boundary moved to the NORTH WEIR (nGateRow now fences
  // the channel too, with a mid-channel ride-through water gate); the
  // south-of-bridge pen row is gone.
  // v48: the offshore RING — a fence boom circling the isle at D 6.8..7.8
  // closing every zone's water into a pen; waist columns/river rows now end
  // at the ring (D<7.8) instead of D<14.
  // v49: SQUARE pens — the organic D-band ring is replaced by one straight
  // rectangular frame (PENF) + full-height waist columns; weir rows span
  // column-to-column. Unique node ids (nodeSeq) also land here.
  // v50: Tūhura pod content round — bank camp gains trees (pail planks),
  // Farm Vale gains cows + extra quail/hens; persisted isle chunks lack the
  // new stamps.
  // v51: NZ native birds — TUT_TAME now keeps bird spawns on the isle and a
  // deterministic bird scatter seeds every isle land chunk; persisted chunks
  // hold spawnDefs from before the strip whitelist grew, i.e. bird-free.
  // v52: isle NATIVE BUSH — every pod thickets up with native-skinned treeT0
  // trees + undergrowth (sprv species skins), and the bird scatter grows to
  // ~8/chunk weighted toward fliers; persisted isle chunks lack all of it.
  // v53: keeper sightlines — no bush trees within 7 tiles of a tutor's post
  // (undergrowth to 3), so the orbiting camera can never lose an NPC behind
  // a crown; v52 isle chunks may have planted right up against them.
  // v54: truthful tree labels — the isle bush is REAL nzt_* natives (proper
  // names + Woodcutting reqs) instead of species-skinned "Tree" nodes, and
  // demoted trees shed their skins; v52/v53 chunks are full of mislabelled
  // treeT0+sprv plants.
  // v55: warden's pit loses its lion (the archery lesson is now the isle's
  // birds) and the Farm Vale loses its cows (milking moved wholly to the
  // Cook's herd); persisted chunks still hold both in their spawnDefs.
  // v56: the pit gains six stamped KOREKE (the slay-5-koreke archery lesson
  // needs guaranteed quail); v55 chunks lack them.
  // v57: bank chests in every second pod past the Banker's (7/9/11/13);
  // persisted chunks lack the new vault stamps.
  // v58: THE RINGED ISLE — Tūhura rebuilt as one circular island (ten outer
  // sectors, four middle chambers, the crown at the centre; radial river,
  // ring/spoke fences, weir arcs). Every old serpentine-chain chunk is void.
  // v59: SINGLE-FILE fences — the ring/spoke/weir lines are rasterized one
  // post wide (terrain.js _tutFenceBuild) instead of a distance band that
  // doubled tiles on diagonals; weir walking-lane moved to the camp bank.
  // v60: unique per-pod biomes, the RIVER GATE journey (gate 1 mid-channel,
  // weirs gone, bank-fenced upstream corridor, spokes into the surf), the
  // Harbour Village (pod 14 tents + evening keepers), the Smith's fuelled
  // furnace, and the Swim-Master's per-character ISLET (whose zone is never
  // persisted — see _persistChunk).
