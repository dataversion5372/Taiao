# Taiao — build the web-distribution zip (itch.io upload).
#
#   tools/build_web_zip.sh          # dist/taiao-web.zip, CDN-lean (default)
#   tools/build_web_zip.sh --full   # include audio + paperdolls locally
#
# The lean zip ships only what must be same-origin-local; everything else
# streams from the Taiao-cdn repo via the service worker's remote fallback
# (sw.js REMOTE_PREFIXES) on first use and caches:
#
#   shipped:   index.html, sw.js, css/, fonts/, dist/bundle.js,
#              libs/three.min.js, assets/sheets/ (all runtime
#              art), assets/bifrost.webm (the graduation cinematic — the one
#              big file we refuse to gamble on a CDN fetch for), license +
#              credits texts.
#   streamed:  sfx / ambience / music (2.6M), birdsong (15M), paperdolls
#              (51M), NPC dialogue bank + MiniLM + npcml runtime (~230M).
#
# ⚠ BEFORE shipping a lean zip, run tools/publish_cdn_assets.sh so the CDN
#   actually holds the streamed layers — otherwise the game runs but stays
#   silent and simple-villagered even online. --full needs no CDN publish
#   (only the ML dialogue layer stays remote, as it does for repo clones).
#
# Webp audit note (2026-09-16): all 42 sheets are already max-effort
# LOSSLESS webp (re-encode at method=6 is byte-identical). Lossy re-encodes
# GREW most sheets (flat-colour pixel art favours VP8L); only gi-item-icons
# (-47% @q95) and mix-npcs-0 (-15% @q90) would shrink, at real quality risk
# on 32px icon art — not taken. The diet is packaging, not recompression.
