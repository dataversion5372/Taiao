# itch.io page — copy + setup checklist

Everything needed to publish the itch.io page. The **Body** section below is
the page description, ready to paste into itch's editor (itch renders this
subset of markdown fine). Claims here must stay TRUE — this page follows the
README's "truthful front page" rule: nothing promised that isn't in the build.

## Setup checklist (itch dashboard)

- **Title:** Taiao — *tagline:* "An endless, living world that can never be
  taken from you."
- **Classification:** Game → Role Playing. **Kind of project:** HTML —
  "This file will be played in the browser".
- **Pricing: $0, donations OFF.** The optional birdsong layer is CC BY-NC-SA
  (non-commercial); taking money on the page that distributes the game is a
  line we don't need to test. Support goes through Ko-fi
  ([ko-fi.com/taiao](https://ko-fi.com/taiao)) linked from the body instead.
- **Embed:** 1280×720 minimum, **fullscreen button ON**, mobile-friendly
  OFF (it isn't — say so, don't fake it). Enable "SharedArrayBuffer support"
  only if testing shows the ML dialogue layer wants it; the game itself
  doesn't.
- **Cover image:** a Bifrost still (the beam over the isle). 630×500.
- **Lead GIF:** record the Bifrost crossing — `tools/record_bifrost.js`
  already drives the cinematic headlessly; capture ~8 s of the pull,
  convert with `ffmpeg -i bifrost.webm -vf "fps=15,scale=640:-1" bifrost.gif`
  and keep it under ~8 MB so itch autoplays it. Place it FIRST in the body.
- **Screenshots (5–6):** dawn chorus forest (birds visible), a synoptic
  weather map, a busy town at dusk with lamplighters, split selves working a
  field, a boat at a sea bridge, the Goals tab mid-arc.
- **Tags:** rpg, open-world, sandbox, crafting, pixel-art, singleplayer,
  relaxing, new-zealand.
- **Upload:** the web zip from `tools/build_web_zip.sh` (see asset-diet
  notes) — index.html at the zip root.

## Body

*(lead GIF here — the Bifrost crossing)*

**Taiao** *(Māori: the natural world)* is a single-player, browser-native RPG
in the spirit of old-school tile-based MMOs — RPG MO, early RuneScape —
rendered HD-2D: a WebGL world with a tilted chase camera, depth fog, and
billboarded pixel art. No install, no account, no telemetry. Your save lives
in your browser.

The world is **endless and alive**. Terrain streams in forever across
15,000²-tile named worlds; weather fronts drift on real isobars; the sun's
shadows follow your latitude and season all the way to a polar midnight sun;
rivers flood after long rain; snow settles and melts; native birds of
Aotearoa fly, perch, and sing — real field recordings, mixed spatially into a
dawn chorus. Everyone plays the same seed: a place you find is a place a
friend can visit.

| The world, by the numbers | |
|---|---|
| Trainable skills | **61** |
| Items | **2,942** |
| Recipes | **2,482** across 45 crafts |
| Creatures | **423**, including 33 bosses |
| Biomes | **37** |
| Crops · resource node types | **160 · 143** |
| Tiers of fish / trees / ores / herbs / runes… | **32 each** — one unlock per level |

New characters wake on **Tūhura Isle**, a hand-built tutorial island of
fifteen keepers, and leave it by a crossing you'll want to see for yourself.
Then: press **X** to split into five bodies working in parallel; speak spells
out loud (hold **V**); talk to villagers in your own words and get answers;
run a workshop economy where goods carry their maker's name; press **I** and
see what the game thinks you love.

### Yours, forever — that's a feature

Taiao is **free software**: the entire game — code (GPL-3.0), art and audio
(CC BY-SA) — lives at
**[github.com/dataversion5372/Taiao](https://github.com/dataversion5372/Taiao)**.
Clone it and it runs from a folder on your machine, offline, for as long as
computers run JavaScript. No publisher can delist it, no server shutdown can
brick it, and if you don't like a thing you can change it. The optional
community server is GPL too and self-hostable — the strongest form of the
promise. If this game matters to you, the repo *is* the game.

### Honest requirements

- **Desktop browser only** — recent Firefox, Chrome/Edge, or Safari with
  hardware acceleration on. **WebGL required.** No touch controls, no
  gamepad: **mouse + keyboard**.
- ~60 MB of game all told, and you're playing well before it finishes —
  the world starts after ~15 MB; the rest of the art streams in behind you.
  Birdsong, music and the NPC semantic-chat layer (~150 MB) arrive quietly
  later and cache. Without them the game still works — quieter skies,
  simpler villagers.
- An **Accessibility** section in the ? tab offers a UI text-size slider
  and a reduced-motion mode (static Bifrost crossing, no shakes or eased
  zooms); the system prefers-reduced-motion setting is honoured by default.
- **Saves are in your browser's storage.** Clearing site data for itch.io
  deletes them. (Playing from a clone of the repo keeps your save in a
  browser profile you control.)
- Made for long sessions and slow evenings; combat exists but this is a
  gathering-crafting-wandering game first.

## Post-publish

- ⚠ Run `tools/publish_cdn_assets.sh` BEFORE uploading the lean zip — the
  zip ships without sfx/ambience/music/paperdolls and streams them from
  Taiao-cdn; until that publish runs, the CDN doesn't hold them.
- Verify the SW registers and caches under the itch subdirectory (sw.js is
  scope-relative as of taiao-v6) — check DevTools → Application → Cache
  Storage on the live page.
- Devlog #1: the Bifrost gif + "the repo is the game" story, cross-linked
  from the README.
