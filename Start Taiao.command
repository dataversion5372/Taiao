# refuse to feed file:// images to WebGL -- so the game must be served over
# http. Double-click this instead of opening index.html directly.
#
# This launcher is deliberately noisy and self-healing: it finds python3 even
# when Finder starts it with a bare PATH, health-checks the port (so a wedged
# old server gets replaced instead of silently serving a dead page), falls back
# to the built-in web server if serve.py can't start, and -- unlike before --
# PRINTS what went wrong and keeps the window open, instead of hiding every
# error in /dev/null.
